# CIS-3310-Project2

For the second project and it's deliverable, I created an authentication login page utilzing cookies. The user will provide their e-mail and a password. Before being linked to a landing page, and for the extent of this project this landing page will be the same index.html page from Project 1, the website will check to see if the user is authorized to enter the page. The website does this through the use of cookies.

Link the the project here: [Project Link](https://tekkyboy.github.io/Authentication-Sampler/)
